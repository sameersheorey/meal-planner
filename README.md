The meal planner is a web application that generates a menu from a pre-loaded selection of recipes. It adds ingredients from menu items to a shopping list after comparing to existing items in the store cupboard database. The program is written in Python and JavaScript using the Flask framework. 

Note: This is a personal project and a work in progress!
